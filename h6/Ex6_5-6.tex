\begin{proof}
Since the edges of a graph and its automorphism are same, total edges of the complete graph be composed of both of them must be even.However, a graph consists of 999 vertices has $C_{999}^2=498501$ edges, which is odd. So there is no self-complementary graph on 999 vertices.
\end{proof}
