\begin{proof}

First we choose a vertex in $G$ to be corresponding to our first vertex, say vertex $1$. There is $2^n$ ways. Note that $n-1$ adjacent vertexes to it can uniquely form a hyperplane and they are all symmetrical. So we arrange them to the adjacent vertexes and there is only $n!$ ways since all the hyperplanes are unique.
As a result, the number of automorphism is $2^nn!$.
