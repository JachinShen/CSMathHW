Let $G = (V, E)$ and $H = (V', E')$ be two graphs. A {\em graph isomorphism} from $G$ to $H$
 is a bijective function $f: V \rightarrow V'$ such that
 for all $u,v \in V$ it holds that $\{u,v\} \in E$ if and only if $\{f(u),f(v)\} \in E'$. 
 If such a function exists, we write $G \cong H$ and say that $G$ and $H$ are {\em isomorphic}.
 In other words, $G$ and $H$ being isomorphic means that they 
 are identical up to the names of its vertices.
 
Obviously, every graph $G$ is isomorphic to itself, because the identity function $f(u) = u$ is an
isomorphism. However, there might be several isomorphisms $f$ from $G$ to $G$ itself.
We call such an isomorphism from $G$ to itself an {\em automorphism} of $G$.

\begin{exercise}
For each of the graphs below, compute the number of automorphisms it has.

Consider the $n$-dimensional Hamming cube $H_n$. This is the graph with vertex
set $\{0,1\}^n$, and two vertices $x,y \in \{0,1\}^n$ are connected by an edge if 
they differ in exactly one edge. For example, the right-most graph in the figure above
is $H_3$.

\begin{exercise}
   Show that $H_n$ has exactly $2^n \cdot n!$ automorphisms.
   Be careful: it is easy to construct $2^n \cdot n!$ different automorphisms. It is 
   more difficult to show that there are no automorphisms other than those.
\end{exercise}

\input{Ex6-2}


A graph $G$ is called {\em asymmetric} if the identity function $f(u) = u$ is the 
only automorphism of $G$. That is, if $G$ has exactly one automorphism.

\begin{exercise}
   Give an example of an asymmetric graph on six vertices.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Find an asymmetric tree.

For a graph $G = (V,E)$, let $\bar{G} := \left(V, {V \choose 2} \setminus E \right)$ denote
its {\em complement graph}.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/graph-complement.pdf}
\end{center}
We call a graph {\em self-complementary} if $G \cong \bar{G}$. The above graph
is not self-complementary. Here is an example of a self-complementary graph:
\begin{center}

\end{center}


\begin{exercise}
   Show that there is no self-complementary graph on $999$ vertices.
\end{exercise}

\input{Ex6_5-6}

\begin{exercise}
 Characterize the natural numbers $n$ for which there is a self-complementary
 graph $G$ on $n$ vertices. That is, state and prove a theorem of the form
 ``There is a self-complementary graph  on $n$ vertices if and only if 
 $n$ \texttt{ <put some simple criterion here>}.''
\end{exercise}
