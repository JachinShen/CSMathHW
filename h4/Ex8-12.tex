\begin{exercise}
 Show that $f_i$ is an involution without a fixed point.
 That is, $f(f(x)) = x$ and $f(x) \ne x$ for all $x \in \{0,1\}^d$.
\end{exercise}

Let $S \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$. We define  $f_i(S)$ as the set arising from applying
$f_i$ to every element of $S$. Formally,
\begin{align*}
f_i(S) := \{ f_i(x) \ | \ x \in S \} \ .
\end{align*}
Given a set $S \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, we call an index $i \in [n]$ {\em active} for $S$
if $f_i(S) \ne S$. 
\begin{exercise}
Let $d=3$ and $S = \{000, 100\}$. Which of the indices $1,2,3$ are active?
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
 Let $S \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$. Show that if $S \ne \emptyset$ and $S \ne \{0,1\}^d$ then
 $S$ has at least one active index.
\end{exercise}


Given $S \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, define $f(S)$ as follows: if $S = \emptyset$ or $S = \{0,1\}^d$
define $f(S) = S$. Otherwise, let $f(S) := f_i(S)$ where $i$ is the smallest active
index of $S$ (which exists by the previous exercise).

\begin{exercise}
 Show that $f$ is an involution. That is, $f(f(S)) = S$. Furthermore, show that
 the only fixed points of $f$ are $\emptyset$ and $\{0,1\}^d$.
\end{exercise} 

\begin{exercise}
   Let $\mathcal{S} = { \{0,1\}^d \choose k }$. This is a set of sets, and each set $S \in \mathcal{S}$
   consists of exactly $k$ strings from $\{0,1\}^d$. Prove the following statements: 
   \begin{enumerate}
   \item $f$ is a bijection from $\mathcal{S}$ to $\mathcal{S}$.
   \item For $1 \leq k \leq 2^d-1$, this bijection is an involution
   without fixed points.
   \item $|\mathcal{S}|$ is even for $1 \leq k \leq 2^d-1$.
   \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
