\begin{exercise}
Show that the Edmonds-Karp algorithm terminates after $n \cdot m$ iterations of the 
while-loop. \textbf{Hint.} Initially, compute an optimal $k$-layering (which?). Then keep
this layering as long as its optimal. Once it ceases to be optimal, compute a new optimal
layering. Note that the Edmonds-Karp algorithm does not actually need to compute any
layering. It's us who compute it to show that $n \cdot m$ bound on the number of iterations.

\begin{exercise}
   Show that every network has a maximum flow $f$. 
   That is, a flow $f$ such that ${\rm val}(f) \geq {\rm val}(f')$ for every flow $f'$.
   \textbf{Remark.} This sounds obvious but it is not. In fact, there might be an infinite
   sequence of flows $f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots$ of increasing value that does not reach any maximum.
    Use the previous exercises!
