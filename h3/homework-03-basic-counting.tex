\section{Basic Counting}

A function $[m] \rightarrow [n]$ is {\em monotone} if $f(1) \leq f(2) \leq \dots \leq f(m)$.
It is  {\em strictly monotone} if $f(1) < f(2) < \dots < f(m)$.

\begin{exercise}
   Find and justify a closed formula for the number of strictly 
   monotone functions from $[m]$ to $[n]$. 
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
   Find and justify a closed formula for the number of monotone functions from $[m]$ to $[n]$. 
\end{exercise}

\textbf{Remark.} By ``closed'' I mean something using expressions like $\times$, $+$, 
${n \choose k}$, $n!$, but not $\sum$ or $\prod$. 
For example, ${n \choose k^2}$ is a closed formula but
$\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}$ is not.


\begin{exercise}
  Prove that $\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k}^2 = {2n \choose n}$ for every $n \geq 0$ by finding a combinatorial interpretation.
\end{exercise}  

\begin{exercise}[From the textbook]
   Find a closed formula for $\sum_{k=m}^n {k \choose m}{n \choose k}$ and prove it combinatorially, i.e., by giving an 
   interpretation.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
   Let $B_n$ be the number of partitions of the set $[n]$ (this is the same as the number
   of equivalence relations on $[n]$). This is called the Bell number, thus we 
   denote it $B_n$.
   Prove that the following recursive formula
   for $B_n$ is correct:
   \begin{align*}
     B_0 & = 1 \\
     B_{n+1} & = \sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} B_k  \ .
   \end{align*}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $P_n$ be the number of ways to write the natural number $n$ as a sum $
  a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k$ such that
  $1 \leq a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \dots \leq a_k$. For example, $3$ can be written
  as $3$, $2 + 1$, and $1 + 1 + 1$, so $P_3 = 3$. 
   Find a recursive formula for $P_n$.\\
   
   \textbf{Remark.} The formula might not be as simple as the above for $B_n$. Be creative!  
   Start by writing a simple recursive program that computes $P_n$.
\end{exercise}
