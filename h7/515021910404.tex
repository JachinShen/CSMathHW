\textbf{Solution.}
My ID is 515021910404. The corresponding score is $(0,0,0,1,1,1,2,4,4,5,5,9)$.
\par There is no graph for this score. As $d'=(0,0,-1,0,0,0,1,3,3,4,4)$, it is impossible to have a negative degree for a vertex of graph.
\par There is a multigraph for this score as the following picture shows. The integers on the edges stands for the number of edges between two vertices.

\par There is a weighted graph because there is already a multigraph.
\par There is a real weighted graph becaues there is already a multigraph.
