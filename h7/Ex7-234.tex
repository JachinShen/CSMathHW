\begin{exercise}
  State a score theorem for multigraphs. That is, something like
  \begin{theorem}[Multigraph Score Theorem]
     Let $(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \N_0^n$. There is a multigraph
     with this score if and only if \texttt{\textup{<fill in some simple criterion here>}}.
  \end{theorem}
  
  
  \textbf{Remark.} This is actually
  simpler than for graphs.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove your theorem.
\end{exercise}
