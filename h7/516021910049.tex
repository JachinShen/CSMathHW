\paragraph{Solution.} My student ID is 516021910049. 
This is a multigraph score, as shown by this picture:
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/graph-516021910049.pdf}
\end{center}
This settles (2). It is not a graph score, because there are total 9 non-zero nodes, but the max degree is 9, so no more nodes to satisfy the degree.
