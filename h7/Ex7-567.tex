\begin{exercise}
  State a score theorem for weighted graphs. That is, state something like
  \begin{theorem}[Weighted Graph Score Theorem]
     Let $(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \R_0^n$. There is a weighted graph
     with this score if and only if \texttt{\textup{<fill in some simple criterion here>}}.
  \end{theorem}
  \textbf{Remark.} This 
  is actually even simpler.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
  Prove your theorem.
