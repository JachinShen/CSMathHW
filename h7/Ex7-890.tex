\begin{exercise}
  State a score theorem for weighted graphs when we allow
  negative edge weights. That is, state a theorem like
  \begin{theorem}[Score Theorem for Graphs with Real Edge Weights]
     Let $(a_1,\dots,a_n) \in \R^n$. There is a  graph with real edge weights
     with this score if and only if \texttt{\textup{<fill in some simple criterion here>}}.
  \end{theorem}  
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Prove your theorem.
